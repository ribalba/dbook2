Build instructions for dbookpy:
$Id$
-------------------------------------------

You need cmake, gcc, (g)make and libdbook.
libdbook may either be installed on the system or built in ../libdook,
assuming you built libdbook in a build/ directory as suggested.

1) Prepare build
It is nice not to clutter the source tree, so we prefer to make a 
'build' dir:

mkdir build && cd build

2) Configure the sources
cmake ..

3) Build
make

NOTE:
As there is no portable way to know where to put the python library,
there is not install target for the generated Makefile. You must put it
in the desired location manually. Sorry.
