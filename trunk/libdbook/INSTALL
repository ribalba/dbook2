Build instructions for libdbook:
$Id$
-------------------------------------------

You need cmake, gcc, (g)make.

1) Prepare build

It is nice not to clutter the source tree, so we prefer to make a 'build' dir:
mkdir build && cd build

2) Configure the sources

cmake ..

By default the install prefix is /usr/local, to specify another use:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path ..

3) Build

make

4) Install

(make sure you have permissions)

make install
